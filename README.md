# AmberFin-iCR-Dashboard

Manage a fleet of Dalet Amberfin iCR machines via the API.

The fleet of iCRs is stored in a list.

There are functions to loop through all of your iCRs, show library entries, show transcodes, query system status, show clips playing and a variety of other functions.

All results are shown async in web page tables using XMLHTTPRequsts.
